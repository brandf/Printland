# Printland
Printland is an open source board game platform that is designed to be 3d printed. As a platform, Printland provides the basic components and a common framework that is used to create Printland based games.

# Components

## Boards
Printland games are played on one or more boards. Each board contains 8x8 tile slots and is 180mm wide. The color of a board is never significant, so that any two Printland boards are interchangable.

## Tiles
Printland games are played with tiles. The basic shape of a tile is standardized to fits into the tile slots of a board. The shape of tiles gives them only one orientation that will fit into a board. Tiles are always flat on one side, and the other side typically contains a symbol. While it depends on the rules of the game, Tiles often start flat side up and some condition triggers them to be flipped, reveiling the symbol underneath. The color of a tile often significant. The rules of a Printland game will tell you what the symbols/colors mean.

## Toppers
Toppers are game pieces that sit on top of a tile. The exact shape of a topper is not standardized, however they should not be more than 1/4 the size of a tile so that more than one topper can sit on the same tile. The rules of a Printland game will tell you how specific toppers are used.

## Modules
A module is simply a collection of tiles and/or toppers (pieces) that share some common theme. Multiple games can depend on the same modules. Each module will have instructions on the number and colors of each piece to print. Modules typically come with an optional printable storage container to help keep you organized. Modules do not dictate how the pieces should be used. That is up to the game rules to define.

## Colors
Tiles/Toppers are limited to 5 easily distinguishable colors. This caps the variety of filament needed to print all modules. The 5 colors are: white, black, red, green, and blue. Different shades of the same basic color are equivalent. For example a semi-transparent light blue tile is equivalent to an opaque dark blue tile with the same symbol.

## Games
Printland games are what you actually play. A game depends on one or more modules. In order to play the game, you need to have all of the required modules, and some games have optional modules for variations of the game. Game instructions share a standardized format to make it easier to learn new Printland games. For example:
